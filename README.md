# Daily LeetCode Bot

A Discord bot that posts daily LeetCode challenges and tracks user progress.

## Features

- Posts a daily LeetCode problem at a configurable time each day.
- Choose problem difficulty: Random (LeetCode's daily), Easy, Medium, or Hard.
- Users can link their LeetCode username.
- Automatic solve detection with manual override option.
- **Community Features**: See who solved today's problem and track streaks.
- **Solve Announcements**: Automatic announcements when someone solves a problem.
- **Enhanced Leaderboards**: Top streaks and active solver tracking.
- Tracks solve streaks based on increase in solved problems count.
- Leaderboard for top streaks.
- Status command to check if you've solved today's problem.
- Per-server configuration for channel, posting time, and difficulty.
- Simple JSON-based data storage (no database required).

## Data Storage

The bot uses a simple JSON file (`bot_data.json`) for data storage instead of a database. This makes it:

- Easier to set up (no database installation needed)
- More portable (single file)
- Human-readable (you can edit the JSON directly if needed)
- Lightweight for small to medium communities
